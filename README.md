- The company is looking for new opportunities to grow its business. For that reason, we are going to analyze Bellabeat smart device usage data to determine key trends and make useful recommendations for the company from that.

- Top 3 recommendations
  - As most adults do not get the recommended hours of sleep, they might look for a solution to improve sleep quality and reduce disorders like insomnia, narcolepsy, etc. Knowing this market demand, the company can tailor their ad content, focusing on showing how Bellabeat products could help women better take care of their sleep.
  - The working class can be a promising segment for Bellabeat products on the account of their strong demand for healthcare solutions. With that knowledge, the company can expand its customer base by launching a marketing campaign that targets this group. The ads should be placed where they can reach lots of office women, e.g. corporate buildings. 
  - Not so many current users choose Bellabeat devices to track their sporting and exercise activities but for other reasons, e.g. its good designs. Then great to have further research on this topic, e.g. a survey to collect information on factors that drive people to purchase Bellabeat products.
